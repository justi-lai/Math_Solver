"A ladder 10 meters long is leaning against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 1 m/s, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom is 6 meters from the wall?","Step 1: Use the Pythagorean theorem: x^2 + y^2 = 10^2, where x is the distance of the bottom of the ladder from the wall and y is the height of the top of the ladder. Step 2: Differentiate both sides with respect to time t: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. Step 3: Solve for dy/dt: dy/dt = -(x(dx/dt))/y. Step 4: Substitute the given values: x = 6 m, dx/dt = 1 m/s, and y = sqrt(10^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(64) = 8 m. Step 5: Calculate dy/dt: dy/dt = -(6 * 1) / 8 = -6/8 = -0.75 m/s. Final Answer: The top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 0.75 m/s."
"A tank is being filled with water at a rate of 5 liters per minute. If the tank has a square base with a side length of 2 meters, how fast is the water level rising when the water is 1 meter deep?","Step 1: Recall the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = base area * height. Step 2: Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t: dV/dt = base area * (d(height)/dt). Step 3: Substitute the given values: dV/dt = 5 liters/min = 0.005 m^3/min, base area = 2^2 = 4 m^2. Step 4: Solve for d(height)/dt: d(height)/dt = dV/dt / base area = 0.005 / 4 = 0.00125 m/min. Final Answer: The water level is rising at a rate of 0.00125 m/min."
